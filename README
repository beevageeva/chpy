Generation of forward files in order to use them with auto response mail programs like procmail or vacation

INSTALLATION:

It is a web interface using cherrypy and jinja2 python libraries
In fedora you should install python-cherrypy and python-jinja2 packages

Copy example files:
cp vacation_config_paths.py.example vacation_config_paths.py
cp procmail_config_paths.py.example procmail_config_paths.py
cp ldap_config.py.example ldap_config.py
and modify them according to your configuration (at least: SERVER_NAME and BASE_USER in ldap_config.py and DOMAIN_NAME in procmail_config_paths.py)


There is also an example file for configuring the application with apache: chpy.conf.apache-example
(here set SetEnv appcontext variable to the application web context or change default appcontext = "chpy" in app.py, but this must be the same as the path of WSGIScriptAlias and should match the first part of the Alias /chpy/static) 

In order to use procmail program set autoresponse_type to 'procmail' in app_config.py and to 'vacation' for vacation program
and modify procmail_config_paths.py and vacation_config_paths.py accordingly

User authentication is done with ldap so modify  ldap settings in ldap_config.py
