Generation of forward files in order to use them with auto response mail programs like procmail or vacation

INSTALLATION:

It is a web interface using cherrypy and jinja2 python libraries
In fedora you should install python-cherrypy and python-jinja2 packages

Copy example files:
cp vacation_config_paths.py.example vacation_config_paths.py
cp procmail_config_paths.py.example procmail_config_paths.py
cp ldap_config.py.example ldap_config.py
and modify them according to your configuration (at least: SERVER_NAME and BASE_USER in ldap_config.py and DOMAIN_NAME in procmail_config_paths.py)


There is also an example file for configuring the application with apache: chpy.conf.apache-example
It uses mod_wsgi (in fedora you must install mod_wsgi package)
(here set SetEnv appcontext variable to the application web context or change default appcontext = "chpy" in app.py, but this must be the same as the path of WSGIScriptAlias and should match the first part of the Alias /chpy/static) 

In order to use procmail program set autoresponse_type to 'procmail' in app_config.py and to 'vacation' for vacation program
and modify procmail_config_paths.py and vacation_config_paths.py accordingly

User authentication is done with ldap so insttall python ldap library (in fedora python-ldap package) and modify  ldap settings in ldap_config.py
Make sure apache has read permission on all folder and write permission for log/site.log (where application logging goes), folder sessions where client sessions are kept and to the folders defined in *_config_paths.py where forward, procmail, message files are kept (in the case of vacation program the message file is .vacation.msg in the user home and this cannot be changed with the current version of vacation program)
